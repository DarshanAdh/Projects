- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data, assistance requests, and other relevant information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React** for building the UI components and managing state.
  - **Vite** for faster development builds and optimized production bundling.
  - **TypeScript** for type safety and improved development tooling.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js** for building the backend API and handling server requests.
  - **Express.js** for handling routes and server-side logic.
  - **MongoDB** for storing and managing data, including assistance requests and user details.
